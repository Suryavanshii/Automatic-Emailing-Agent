# Automatic Emailing Agent
This is a small project I built to send emails automatically.
The idea is simple – just log in with your Gmail (app password), write your message, add recipient emails, and send.

# Features
Send emails to multiple people at once
Simple and clean interface
Status shows if the email was sent or failed

# Tech Used
Python (Flask)
HTML / CSS
smtplib

# How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements → pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run → python app.py
4. Open → http://127.0.0.1:5000/

# Note
You’ll need a Gmail App Password to log in (not your normal Gmail password).
